# AUTOMATED TRAFFIC DATA COLLECTION, STORAGE, AND REPORTING PLATFORM

## I. Project Summary
This paper aimed to investigate the current traffic data collection, storage, reporting, and information-gathering methods in Lagos, Nigeria. 

## II. Project Problem
Understanding the predicted traffic load on the road is essential to any road construction. Therefore, this paper aimed to investigate the current traffic data collection, 
storage, reporting, and information-gathering methods. 
The results of the study, which used Lagos State, Nigeria as a case study, showed that the current process is a manual one,
in which data collection is carried out manually by some trained group of people or surveyors who go out to take count of various vehicles 
moving on the road in a specific location at a specific time interval. This method's weakness results from the data's significant error rate. 
Even though past data that allows for prediction is not yet available, the data quality could be compromised, making the data dirty, inconsistent, and non-conforming which would defeat the primary goal of data collecting in the first place.

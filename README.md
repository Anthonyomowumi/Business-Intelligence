# AUTOMATED TRAFFIC DATA COLLECTION, STORAGE, AND REPORTING PLATFORM

## I. Project Summary
This paper aimed to investigate the current traffic data collection, storage, reporting, and information-gathering methods in Lagos, Nigeria and provide a solution through the use artificial intelligence traffic cameras in place of manual counting, creating a data warehouse, and including a reporting software tool in the solution, this study led to the development of an effective business intelligence solution for Engineers when it comes to Road Construction.

## II. Project Problem
Understanding the predicted traffic load on the road is essential to any road construction. Therefore, this paper aimed to investigate the current traffic data collection, 
storage, reporting, and information-gathering methods. 
The results of the study, which used Lagos State, Nigeria as a case study, showed that the current process is a manual one,
in which data collection is carried out manually by some trained group of people or surveyors who go out to take count of various vehicles 
moving on the road in a specific location at a specific time interval. This method's weakness results from the data's significant error rate. 
Even though past data that allows for prediction is not yet available, the data quality could be compromised, making the data dirty, inconsistent, and non-conforming which would defeat the primary goal of data collecting in the first place.

## III. Data Description
A Manually Count data collected on location 01 - Towards Mile 2 Westbound, Along Lagos Badagry Expressway, Lagos State, Nigeria between 21st July and 25th July 2022 was used for the analysis in this study. The dataset consist of 144 rows and 12 columns. The collected features in the dataset period, date, and time including the categories of vehicles. The count was manually taken from 6:15 am to 6 pm on a chosen day/date. The time was subdivided to allow for easy classification and visualization.

Although already clean and entered Excel tool. Python, a data analysis tool was used to get some insight into the information in the data and summary statistics of the dataset

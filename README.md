# AUTOMATED TRAFFIC DATA COLLECTION, STORAGE, AND REPORTING PLATFORM Project

# Abstract

Understanding the predicted traffic load on the road is essential to any road construction. Therefore, this paper aimed to investigate the current traffic data collection, 
storage, reporting, and information-gathering methods. The results of the study, which used Lagos State, Nigeria as a case study, showed that the current process is a manual one,
in which data collection is carried out manually by some trained group of people or surveyors who go out to take count of various vehicles 
moving on the road in a specific location at a specific time interval. This method's weakness results from the data's significant error rate. 
Even though past data that allows for prediction is not yet available, the data quality could be compromised, making the data dirty, inconsistent, and non-conforming. 

This would defeat the primary goal of data collecting in the first place. Sample data from location 01 – Towards Mile 2 – Westbound, along Lagos Badagry Expressway, Lagos State,
Nigeria between 21st July – 25th July 2022 was used in this study. The process, the data collecting template, the categories of vehicles tallied, and the time for each count 
were all understood using the sample data. Furthermore, it was discovered that the data was stored mostly on hard drives, and flash drives,
and was entered into an Excel spreadsheet, making the data particularly vulnerable to errors in data collecting, counting, or entering. 
By using artificial intelligence traffic cameras in place of manual counting, creating a data warehouse, and including a reporting software tool in the solution,
this study led to the development of an effective business intelligence solution for Engineers when it comes to Road Construction.
